	<p>We lost the ICPC Regionals!!</p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>After a grueling five hour match our team couldn&rsquo;t solve a single exercise. We were very out of it at the end and just couldn&rsquo;t find a way to solve any of the exercises. Even though the exercises were pretty hard some of our solutions were indeed correct but couldn&rsquo;t beat the time limit they gave us for those exercises. For example one of the exercises was to find out all the numbers between 2 and N that fit the following description:</p>
<p>For x in <code>[2, N]</code>, N base x is a palindrome. The complicated part of this problem being the fact that the largest N they give you is 2^15 and your time limit is 1 second. Changing a decimal number to a different base will always take an <code>O(log n)</code> amount of steps; checking if it&rsquo;s a palindrome will take <code>O(n/2)</code> steps max; doing that for every number in <code>[2, N]</code> is <code>O(n log(n))</code>. Note that an average computer can only do 10^8 calculations per second, but our largest number is 2^15 which means that anything equal or slower in complexity than a linear solution would be too slow.</p>
<p>During the competition several things we noticed were that N in <code>[3, N)</code> will always have at least 1 palindrome in the base <code>N-1</code>. That is because you can always express <code>N</code> as <code>(1 * (N-1) + 1)</code>. The next palindrome number would be 22 but wwe couldn&rsquo;t notice why this palindrome would only sometimes appear.</p>
<p>For the sake of explanation I will refer to <code>palindrome-pairs</code> as a palindrome made of 2 digits.</p>
<p>After the competition concluded, on the ride back, our professor had mentioned that you will always have palindrome-pairs made of the factors of that number strictly less than that number&rsquo;s square root. Which makes sense for our first example since every number has the number 1 as a factor. Furthermore, the number 36, whose factors are: { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 18, 36 } can be expressed as:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 in base 35</li>
<li>22 in base 17</li>
<li>33 in base 11</li>
<li>44 in base 8</li>
<li>121 in base 6 awwww
It was almost working.</li>
</ul>
<p>I say almost because 121 IS a palindrome but it&rsquo;s also not a palindrome-pair. Unfortunately we couldn&rsquo;t come up with any better algorithm for this and ended up submitting this solution twice and getting TLE&rsquo;d.</p>
