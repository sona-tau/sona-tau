## Hello there

- Linux and open source software is pretty awesome.
- Naming things is not awesome.
- I love functional languages like [APL](https://tryapl.org/), [J](https://www.jsoftware.com/), [BQN](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
- I hate naming things.
